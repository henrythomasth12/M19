# Overveiw
With the experience we gained through the course we are ready for bigger harder challenges. Are next project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.We do this by:
* prcessing the data in the neural network model
* compile and train the model 
* Then we optimize it 
# Summary 
Wit hthe model we used it didnt reach an acuracy of 75% but it reach at a accuract of 72% which is a little bit off from the target we wanteded.
